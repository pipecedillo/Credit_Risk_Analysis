# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

Different techniques were used to determine risky loans to clients.

## Results:

# Summary: 

Through the 6 different techniques we used to detect high lever risk loans, we figured out that the results are similar with the exception of the Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier who was the model with the best accuracy. I would definetly recommend using this learning model for credit car analysis.
